# What to do
Let's say what we want to build an internal database of our customers so we can easily see who they all are. Since we've not started working with our own local databases yet, we will instead use an open API called Random User. This is where we will pull all of our data from.  Use the mockup below to create a page full of 12 users.  
  You will also need to use flex-box and media queries (@media) to make it responsive.  Your goal is to make the mobile view be a column of users while the desktop view is like the mockup.
